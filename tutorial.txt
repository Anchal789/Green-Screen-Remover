Explanation of Changes:
1. Canvas Initialization:
 - Set both c.width and c.height to match the video size initially and on window resize.
 - Added updateCanvasSize function to handle this.
2. Green Screen Removal Logic:
 - Fine-tuned the condition to better identify green pixels by checking if r < 100 && g > 100 && b < 100. This should be adjusted based on the exact green screen shade you are working with.

3.Animation Frame:
 - requestAnimationFrame is now correctly used inside the drawVid function to continuously update the canvas.
 - Added a check to stop the loop if the video is paused or ended.

4. Responsive Canvas:
 -Added an event listener for window resize to update the canvas size accordingly.

How It Works:
 - When the video plays, the drawVid function is called using requestAnimationFrame.
 - The current frame of the video is drawn onto the canvas.
 - The pixel data is processed to set the alpha (transparency) of green pixels to 0.
 - The modified image data is put back onto the canvas.
 - requestAnimationFrame is called again to continue the loop, ensuring smooth updates to the canvas as the video plays.
